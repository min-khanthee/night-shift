# Night Shift

Night Shift lets you **dim selected lines in your code editor** to reduce visual clutter.

Ideal for:

- Tracing data flow
- Simplifying complex files
- Focusing on the logic you care about

---

## Features

- **Isolate mode**: Dim everything _except_ the lines you select (`Cmd + Shift + 1`)
- **Toggle dim**: Dim or undim selected lines (`Cmd + Shift + 2`)
- **Clear dims in current file** (`Cmd + Shift + 9`)
- **Clear all dims across all files** (`Cmd + Shift + 0`)
- Subtle, non-destructive styling â€” your code stays clean

## Why?

Sometimes, the hardest part of reading code is ignoring what you donâ€™t need.

Night Shift gives you a soft focus tool â€” think of it like a spotlight for your mind.
